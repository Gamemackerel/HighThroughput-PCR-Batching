# HighThroughput-PCR-Batching
An algorithm which allows optimized batching of as many pcr operations as possible in a set amount of thermocyclers.

This algorithm was made for and belongs to the [Aquarium](https://github.com/klavinslab/aquarium) open source project. The "make PCR fragment" protocol on the starter database shipped with Aquarium implements this algorithm to optimize the amount of pcrs that can be run at once.
